                                    of our third-party service providers. Your use of the Services may require that our

                                    Netherlands, Singapore, and United Kingdom have access to the information.

                                    local laws which may differ from yours, we safeguard the transfer of information we
                                    collect from the European Economic Area and Switzerland to the United States. We are no
                                    longer participating in the EU-U.S Privacy Shield, nor the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield,
                                    but we are safeguarding transfers through other means such as standard contractual data
                                    protection clauses, which have been approved by the European Commission and Switzerland,
                                    and/or the Verizon Binding Corporate Rules, as applicable. In some cases we may use
                                    other appropriate legal mechanisms to safeguard the transfer. Please see our Trust
                                    Center for further information about standard contractual data protection clauses.

                                    If you are an Australian national, where Rubiktalk discloses personal information (as
                                    defined by the Australian Privacy Act) of Australian nationals with third parties
                                    outside of Australia, Rubiktalk will operate in a manner materially consistent with the
                                    applicable Australian Privacy Principles and seek to ensure that the third party
                                    recipient holds and uses the personal information consistently with the applicable
                                    Australian Privacy Principle and other applicable privacy laws.

                                    Where we provide access to the Services to you under contract with an organization (for
                                    example your employer), or if you use an email address provided by an organization to
                                    access the Services, that organization may act as the controller of the information.
                                    Your use of the Services may be subject to that organization's policies. Each
                                    organization may appoint administrative users of the Services. An administrator may have
                                    the ability to access, modify, and/or delete certain information that you have provided,
                                    give information to Third Party Sites (as defined below), and restrict your access to
                                    the Services and information in whole or in part.

                                    In this situation, Rubiktalk is the processor, rather than the controller, of your
                                    information. Where we are the processor, we do not control why or how your information
                                    is used, and you will need to contact your relevant controller (e.g. your employer
                                    and/or the company which provides you access to the Services) to find out about your
                                    data protection rights and responsibilities. All questions about your organization’s
                                    policies and administrative user access rights should be directed to your organization.

                                    and cannot control whether your use of the Services is being video recorded or audio
                                    recorded, via the Services or a third-party technology. If you do not want to be
                                    recorded during your use of the Services, you may inform your host of that decision
                                    and/or decline to use the Services.

                                    the right to:

                                    · Request a record of information you have provided

                                    <br /> <br />
                                    · Request that, to the extent reasonably possible, information be provided in a

                                    You can exercise many of these abilities directly through the Services via your
                                    Rubiktalk profile page. You may opt out of non-transactional emails through the email
                                    notification center. For any issue that cannot be handled on a self-service basis,
                                    please reach out to our Support team for assistance. You can also exercise the rights
                                    listed above at any time by contacting us at info@rubiktalk.com. In some instances, if
                                    you access the Services under contract with an organization, we may be required to
                                    direct your inquiries to an administrative user.
                                    <br /> <br />
                                    If you no longer want to use our Services, you may choose not to access our website or
                                    video-conferencing services at any time and, as applicable, you will need to reach out
                                    to our Support team or an administrative user to deactivate your account. If you are an
                                    organizational user of the Services, you will need to arrange for an administrative user
                                    to remove personal data associated with your account. Otherwise, personal data will be
                                    deleted or obfuscated within 180 days of the deactivation of your account.

                                    You may contact our Support team to ask us to stop accessing, storing, using and
                                    otherwise processing your information where our legal basis for doing so relies on your
                                    consent or is otherwise objectionable by law. Where you gave us consent to use your
                                    information for a limited purpose, you can contact our Support team to withdraw that
                                    consent, but this will not affect any processing already occurred. Where you withdraw
                                    your consent, but we are also using your information under a different legal basis (for
                                    example, fulfilling a contract with you), we may continue to process your information,
                                    subject to your rights to access and control your information. Please note that we may
                                    need to retain certain information to fulfill legal obligations, in accordance with our
                                    record retention practices, or to complete transactions.

                                    encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to
                                    help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide
                                    information via the Services without permission. If you have reason to believe that a
                                    minor has provided information to Rubiktalk, please contact us and we will endeavor to
                                    delete that information from our databases.

                                    Please review this Policy periodically. Your continued use of the Services after any
                                    changes or revisions to this Policy indicates that you have read and understood the
